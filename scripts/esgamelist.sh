It will remove all entries from a gamelist.xml file where there is no matching rom file.  This process will create a curated gamelist.xml file only containg entries for rom files it locates in the particular system rom folder.\n\nFor those systems with large romsets like MAME/FBA, the script will take awhile to run.\n\nYou can monitor it's progress with this file:  /tmp/remove.txt\n\n---You must restart Emulation Station after making these changes---\n\nWARNING: Always make a backup copy of your gamelist.xml and media files before making changes to your system.\n\n\nDo you want to proceed?" \
